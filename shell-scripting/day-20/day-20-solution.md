## Tools & Commands Used
- grep – Used for searching and filtering log lines based on patterns like ERROR, Failed, and CRITICAL.
- awk – Used for text processing, especially to remove timestamps and extract meaningful parts of log messages.
- sed – Used for formatting output (e.g., adding Line <number>: before critical events, trimming spaces).
- sort – Used to arrange log entries so duplicate messages can be grouped together.
- uniq -c – Used to count occurrences of repeated error messages.
- wc -l – Used to count total lines and number of error entries.
- head – Used to limit output to the top 5 most frequent error messages.
- date – Used to generate dynamic filenames for reports (e.g., log_report_<date>.txt).
- mv – Used to move processed log files into an archive/ directory.
- mkdir -p – Used to create the archive directory if it doesn’t already exist.
- Shell features – Variables, conditionals (if), loops, and command substitution ($(...)) to build automation logic.

## What I Learned
- How to break a larger automation problem into smaller focused scripts (input validation, error counting, critical events, top errors) and then combine them into one complete solution.
- How to use core Linux tools like grep, awk, sort, uniq, sed, and wc together to extract meaningful insights from raw log data.
- Bash scripting can automate real-world log analysis tasks efficiently.
- Combining grep + awk + sort + uniq is a powerful pattern for log processing and data analysis.
- The importance of defensive scripting—validating inputs and handling missing files before processing.
- How to generate structured summary reports with dynamic filenames using date.
- File handling and path management are critical when working with scripts that move or modify files.
- How to automate post-processing tasks like archiving analyzed logs to keep directories clean and organized.
